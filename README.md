# pokemon_team
Idea for building competitive pokemon teams

The application would either take in six types/dual types of Pokemon eg. (grass, water, fire) and build the user a balanced team with moves, items, abilities and ev spreads,
or the user would give a couple specific Pokemon they would like on their team, and then build a team around those Pokemon. This would only use Pokemon in the most recent game.

Would use PokeAPI v2
